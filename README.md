# ACCESS: A Computer Controlled Electronic Spread Sheet for the Commodore 64 with Simons' BASIC

THE premier spreadsheet software package for the C64, written in fast* Commodore BASIC with Simons' BASIC extensions, you'll be blown away by the extensive features and powerful numeric calculation capabilities.

I'd seen Lotus 1-2-3 at College and thought it was quite cool, so I thought I'd write something similar on my C64 for my UK Computer Studies A-level project.

I had a whole school year to complete the project, but 95% of the progarm was written over one crunch-mode weekend, ahead of the Monday morning hand-in deadline. I started working after school on Friday night and didn't stop until Monday morning.

There's nothing like a deadline to concentrate the mind. I remember the sun going down, coming back up again...go down...come up...etc. I got angry at one point and ripped the curtains off the curtain rail, which didn't help reflections on the telly I was using.

But most importantly, I passed the A-Level :-)

- Formula calualation
- Absolute and Relative copying to multiple cells
